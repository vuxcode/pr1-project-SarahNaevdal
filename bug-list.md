1. Tried to use the same codes to connect the first two buttons but they both lead to the same page. 
2. Tried using if-statements but ended up with two functions instead, one for each button.  
3. I have been searching for ways to get buttons on multiple pages. I now think it would be better to update the two buttons from page 1 since every page is going to have two buttons.
4. There are no buttons on page 2.1. I could replace the text on page 1 with the text of the new page?
5. How do I make the same button update the text on the screen several times? Can I hide the headline when leaving the first page?
