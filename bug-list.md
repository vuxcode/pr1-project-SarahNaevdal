1. Tried to use the same codes to connect the first two buttons but they both lead to the same page. 
2. Tried using if-statements but ended up with two functions instead, one for each button.  
3. I have been searching for ways to get buttons on multiple pages. I now think it would be better to update the two buttons from page 1 since every page is going to have two buttons.
